# DATASSim

**Simulator for DATAS machine language**  

### About this project

DATAS is an educational, artificial machine language designed in the 1970s to demonstrate how machine code works.

It had no real hardware, i.e. it did not belong to a real computer, but was a theoretical machine that was treated as a "machine" for educational purposes.

Its typical use was to teach Fortran or other high-level languages, so that students could understand what was going on "under the hood".

I discovered it in the Hungarian translation of the book *Algorithms and their computer solutions* [^1]. This is the only source, I couldn't find anything about it on the Internet.

> [!NOTE]
> If anyone has any information or memories about this language that they can share, I  will be happy to take them and include them in the documentation.
>

I deviated from the description in the book in that the third digit from the right of the word consisting of eight decimal numbers (the tens place value of the second, D1 group) indicates the sign, so that negative numbers can also be handled.
The memory cells can be commented on, as this is an educational model.

A special feature is that the memory cells can be commented on, as this is an educational model.
